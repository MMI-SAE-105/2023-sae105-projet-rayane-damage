          First, <em>Justin K. Thompson</em> who is the only one of the three to have already worked on the first opus of the trilogy: <em>Spiderman: into the spider-verse</em>. At this moment, he was in charge of realizing the majority of the movie’s backgrounds. He is also known for his work on the films: <em>Cloudy with a chance of meatballs</em> where he was <a href="glossary.html" class="gl__link">production designer</a>. That way,
          with his experience and his relationships with film directors, he was able to hold the job of
          film director for the two last films of the Miles Morales trilogy.

          <em>Kemp Powers</em> is the second film director of the movie; he first wasn’t well known by
          the public even if he was writer for the movie <em>One night in Miami</em> and the first season of the series <em>Star Trek: Discoveries</em>. It’s in 2020 that he becomes actually famous, co-directing the
          Pixar movie <em>Soul</em> and became the first Afro-American to be film director on a Disney movie. He is now also in charge of directing the two last films of the Miles’ trilogy alongside the two other film directors.

          The third and most known film director is <em>Joaquim Dos Santos</em>. He first was a <a href="glossary.html" class="gl__link">storyboard artist</a> for the animated series <em>Justice League</em> and then was elevated to film director for the third season. Then, he joined the team of <em>Avatar: the last airbender</em> but this time as a <a href="glossary.html" class="gl__link">storyboard artist</a> again. But, starting at the third season, he was promoted to film director another time. Moreover, he was co-film director on the sequel series <em>The legend of Korra</em>. Finally, he went back to work at Warner Bros to direct 2 short films: <em>The Spectre</em> and <em>Jonah Hex</em>. He’ll end at the job of film director <em>Spiderman: Across the spider-verse</em> and its sequel: <em>Beyond the spider-verse</em>.
